## Introduction:
### This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that you  have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data  is used to minimise the risk of losing 
### money while lending to customers.

### Business Understanding:
### The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

### Business Understanding 
### When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
### Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
### Types of Risks:
### 1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
### 2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
